### Optimizing rendering performance in React: : Utilizing memo & useCallback 🚀


🎯 The Challenge:

Rendering large lists of items can lead to performance bottlenecks, causing sluggish user experiences and excessive resource consumption.

😎 The Solution:

1️⃣ Leverage memo: Wrap functional components with memo to avoid unnecessary re-renders. Components will only update when their props change, saving valuable processing time.

2️⃣ Harness useCallback: Employ useCallback to memoize functions, preventing them from being recreated during each render. This optimizes the rendering process and enhances overall performance.

🔍 React Profiler:

Employ the React Profiler, accessible through your browser's React DevTools, to:

1️⃣ Identify redundant renders.
2️⃣ Analyze render durations for potential optimization opportunities.
